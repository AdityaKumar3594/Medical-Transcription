Doctor-Patient Conversation - Cardiology Case
Patient: Good morning, Doctor. I've been feeling a bit breathless lately, especially when climbing
stairs or walking briskly.
Doctor: Good morning. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me how long this has been going on?
Patient: It started about three weeks ago. I thought it might just be stress or lack of sleep, but it
hasn't improved.
Doctor: Do you experience any chest pain or tightness along with the breathlessness?
Patient: Yes, sometimes I feel a bit of pressure in my chest, especially after physical activity. It
usually goes away when I rest.
Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
Patient: A little, especially towards the end of the day. I assumed it was because I sit a lot at work.
Doctor: Do you have any history of heart disease in your family?
Patient: Yes, my father had a heart attack when he was 52. My grandfather also had some heart
issues.
Doctor: Thank you. Based on your symptoms and family history, I'm concerned there may be an
issue with your heart's ability to pump efficiently. We should run an ECG and possibly an
echocardiogram to evaluate further.
Patient: Okay, Doctor. Is it something serious?
Doctor: It's too early to say, but these tests will help us find out. It's good you came in early. If it's
something like early heart failure or angina, we can manage it well with medication and lifestyle
changes.
Patient: Alright. Should I stop exercising?
Doctor: For now, avoid any strenuous activity until we get your test results. We'll adjust your activity
level based on the diagnosis.
Patient: Got it. Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Let's schedule the tests and follow up as soon as we have the results.
